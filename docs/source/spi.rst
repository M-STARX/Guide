What is SPI?
-----------

SPI is a communication protocol, it allows devices to communicate in a full-duplex mode 
(bidirectional) with one device serving as the Master and every other device as the Slave.
If have worked with I2C then you know that this is a half-duplex communication method as only one device can comminucate over a cable at a time.
